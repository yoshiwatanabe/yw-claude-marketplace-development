# Example Reference Guide

This is an example reference file loaded on-demand by the skill.

## How This Works

When you ask "Show me an example" or "What's in the references?", the skill loads this file to provide additional detail.

## Key Points

- References keep SKILL.md simple and focused
- Users discover references when they need them
- Each reference file covers one specific topic

## Example Scenario

**User:** "I need more details"
**Response:** Load this file and explain the concept

That's the whole pattern. Progressive disclosure—essential info first, details on demand.
